# Wordle Clone v1.0

## Project summary

This is a clone of the popular Web-based game called Wordle. It will be written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and will have much of the same functionality. This project was started on _Thursday, 6th October 2022_ and was authored by _Eti-ini Bernard Effiong-Robert._


## Project Stack
---
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Git/GitHub, for version control and cloud repository

## Project aims
---
I tried to imitate the original Wordle as much as I could, and the project is more to test my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript than to actually impress anyone! I'm really glad I could complete this, and I think it is a solid foray into the world of Web development.
